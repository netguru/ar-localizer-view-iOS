# This `bitrise.yml` variant contains the default configuration to be used in
# an iOS app repository. You can strip the comments in your `bitrise.yml`, if
# you want.
#
# Also, those scripts use the following environment variables that are declared
# publicly in the following file:
#
# - `XCODEBUILD_PROJECT`: A path to a project or a workspace Xcode file.
#
# - `XCODEBUILD_SCHEME`: A name of the scheme to be built.
#
# - `XCODEBUILD_OPTIONS`: Additional build settings passed straight to each
#   `xcodebuild` invocation.
#

# CLI metadata.
#
# This metadata is required to always be in `bitrise.yml`. The `format_version`
# setting will be occasionally bumped.
